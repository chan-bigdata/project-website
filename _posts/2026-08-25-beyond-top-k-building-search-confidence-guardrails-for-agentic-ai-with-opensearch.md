Agentic AI has moved retrieval from a supporting role to a foundation. When an autonomous agent plans, reasons, and iteratively calls tools to answer a question, it depends on retrieval to supply relevant, timely, and complete context at every step. OpenSearch has invested heavily in making that retrieval better and more accessible to agents: [hybrid search](https://opensearch.org/blog/building-effective-hybrid-search-in-opensearch-techniques-and-best-practices/), native [agentic search](https://opensearch.org/blog/introducing-agentic-search-in-opensearch-transforming-data-interaction-through-natural-language/) (a conversational agent that plans tool use and generates query DSL from natural language, generally available since OpenSearch 3.2), the **Agentic Chat**, **Investigation Agent**, and **Agentic Memory** capabilities built into OpenSearch UI, and rigorous [relevance evaluation](https://opensearch.org/blog/evaluating-agentic-search-in-opensearch/).

But there is a dimension that better retrieval and even native agentic orchestration does not address: **knowing when not to act.** Agentic search can plan tool calls and generate an optimized query; the Investigation Agent can autonomously plan, execute, and reflect through a multi-step root-cause analysis. Neither ships a built-in signal for "none of what I retrieved is good enough to act on." A retrieval system that always returns its best guess can mislead an agent into acting confidently on a result that is, in fact, irrelevant.

This post introduces a practical framework of the **Confidence Layer** that gives agents the ability to say "I'm not confident enough to act on this," and shows how to implement it with OpenSearch primitives, as a complement to (not a replacement for) OpenSearch's native agentic tooling.

This is a conceptual deep dive with illustrative code. The snippets map to real OpenSearch features (normalization processors, min_score, script_score, and reranking via ML Commons); the composite-confidence and abstention logic lives in your agent orchestration layer.

## The problem: when agents trust blindly

Consider a realistic failure. An internal knowledge agent receives the query "how to rotate API keys in production." It retrieves a top-ranked document, treats rank #1 as ground truth, and follows a deprecated 2022 runbook. The result is a production incident that could have been avoided if the agent had recognized that no sufficiently relevant document existed.

The underlying issue is that **agents tend to treat retrieval rank as ground truth.** Top-K retrieval returns K results by construction even when nothing relevant exists in the index. There is no built-in signal that says "none of these are good enough."

In a single-shot search interface, a human reviews the results and applies judgment. In an agentic workflow, the agent acts on the results directly, and one weak retrieval can compound: the agent builds subsequent reasoning and tool calls on wrong context, producing a cascading chain of errors.

## Why Top-K falls short in agentic workflows

Several characteristics of raw retrieval scores make them unreliable as a trust signal for autonomous action:

- **Scores are not normalized across methods.** BM25 scores commonly range from 0 to 25 or higher, while cosine similarity for vector search sits between 0 and 1. Comparing or combining them directly is comparing different scales.
- **Scores are not comparable across queries.** A BM25 score of 8.5 on one query does not represent the same relevance as 8.5 on another, because scores depend on term frequencies and corpus statistics specific to each query.
- **There is no "I don't know" signal.** Top-K always returns K results. Absence of a relevant document looks identical to presence of one where the agent receives a ranked list either way.
- **Errors cascade.** In iterative tool use, one weak retrieval propagates. The agent reasons over wrong context and may take further actions that amplify the original mistake.

## Setting up the base: common approaches and their gaps

Before adding a confidence layer, it is worth getting the retrieval foundation right. OpenSearch supports three widely used techniques that meaningfully improve retrieval quality.

### 1. Hybrid retrieval with score normalization

Combining BM25 with vector (k-NN) search captures both keyword precision and semantic recall. OpenSearch implements this with a [hybrid query](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/hybrid/) plus a [normalization processor](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/normalization-processor/) search pipeline (introduced in OpenSearch 2.10) that normalizes and combines sub-query scores. Normalization rescales BM25 and vector scores onto a common range so they can be combined; self-managed OpenSearch supports min-max, L2, and [z-score](https://opensearch.org/blog/introducing-the-z-score-normalization-technique-for-hybrid-search/) techniques. Managed offerings such as Amazon OpenSearch Serverless currently support min-max and L2 normalization with arithmetic-mean, geometric-mean, and harmonic-mean combination. Please check your OpenSearch version and deployment mode before assuming z-score is available.

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/nlp-search-pipeline
{
  "phase_results_processors": [
    {
      "normalization-processor": {
        "normalization": { "technique": "min_max" },
        "combination": {
          "technique": "arithmetic_mean",
          "parameters": { "weights": [0.3, 0.7] }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

RRF merges ranked lists using rank position rather than raw scores, which sidesteps the score-calibration problem:

```
RRF_score(d) = Σ 1 / (k + rank_i(d))     # k = 60 is a common smoothing constant
```

### 3. Reranking with a cross-encoder

A cross-encoder rescores the top candidates using full query–document attention, producing more precise ordering as a second pass. OpenSearch supports this through the [rerank processor](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/search-plugins/search-relevance/reranking-search-results/) via ML Commons:

```json
"response_processors": [
  {
    "rerank": {
      "ml_opensearch": { "model_id": "<cross_encoder_model_id>" },
      "context": { "document_fields": ["content"] }
    }
  }
]
```

### 4. Native agentic search

OpenSearch also lets an agent generate the query itself. [Agentic search](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/vector-search/ai-search/agentic-search/index/) registers a conversational agent backed by an LLM and a QueryPlanningTool: you send a natural-language question, and the agent plans tool use, produces the query DSL, executes it, and returns a natural-language summary of what it did. Amazon OpenSearch Service supports this starting with OpenSearch version 3.3.

Separately, OpenSearch UI ships:

1. **Agentic Chat** (natural-language-to-PPL for log exploration),
2. **Investigation Agent** (a goal-driven agent that autonomously plans, executes, and reflects for root-cause analysis), and
3. **Agentic Memory** (session continuity across both).

These are agent-facing conveniences for *querying* where they still hand back a ranked or generated result for the calling agent or user to act on.

### Why these are not sufficient on their own

Each technique improves *ranking* or *query generation*, but none provides a trustworthy *trust signal*. Consider the query "how to rotate API keys in production," where the correct document ranks modestly on keywords but strongly on semantics, and a deprecated runbook ranks #1 on keyword overlap:

- **Hybrid search** with default min-max normalization always maps the top result to 1.0 even when the top result is the deprecated runbook. The agent sees 1.0 and trusts it.
- **RRF** discards score information entirely. It can surface the "best of irrelevant results" with no way to threshold on confidence, because rank fusion has no notion of absolute relevance.
- **Reranking** orders all candidates, including a set that may be uniformly irrelevant. A cross-encoder logit is designed for ordering, not calibrated confidence, and the processor still returns a ranked list.
- **Agentic search** plans and executes a query competently, but the QueryPlanningTool still returns whatever the generated query matches. It does not evaluate whether the match is good enough to act on.

None of these lets the agent conclude: "I'm not confident enough to act." That is the gap the Confidence Layer fills, as a layer that sits downstream of any of these retrieval paths including agentic search itself.

## The Confidence Layer: quantify, threshold, abstain

The Confidence Layer sits between retrieval and action. It takes the (normalized) retrieval results and decides whether the agent should act, act with a caveat, seek clarification, escalate, or decline. It rests on three pillars.

### Pillar 1: Quantify — multi-signal confidence scoring

A single score can be misleading, so the Confidence Layer combines several signals into a composite confidence value:

1. **Score magnitude**: How high is the top normalized score?
2. **Score gap**: The difference between the #1 and #2 results. A large gap suggests a clear winner; a small gap suggests ambiguity.
3. **Result coherence**: Do the top results point to the same answer, or do they disagree?
4. **Freshness**: How recently were the top documents updated? (Relevant to the deprecated-runbook case.)
5. **Source authority**: Official documentation versus a forum post versus deprecated content.

For hybrid queries, the normalization processor unifies raw scores; the agent layer then computes composite confidence from the signals above:

```python
def compute_confidence(results):
    hits = results["hits"]["hits"]
    scores = [hit["_score"] for hit in hits]

    score_magnitude = scores[0]
    score_gap = scores[0] - scores[1] if len(scores) > 1 else 0
    coherence = compute_coherence(hits)      # agreement among top results
    freshness = avg_freshness(hits)          # recency of top documents
    authority = avg_authority(hits)          # source authority signal

    confidence = (
        0.35 * score_magnitude +
        0.25 * score_gap +
        0.20 * coherence +
        0.10 * freshness +
        0.10 * authority
    )
    return confidence
```

The weights above are a starting point; tune them against a judged query set for your corpus, as described in [Optimizing hybrid search in OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/hybrid-search-optimization/).

Some of these signals can also be pushed into OpenSearch at query time. For example, `script_score` can factor authority and freshness directly into ranking for non-hybrid queries:

```json
POST /index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "script_score": {
      "query": { "match": { "content": "rotate API keys" } },
      "script": {
        "source": "_score * (1 + doc['authority'].value * 0.3 + doc['freshness'].value * 0.2)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Pillar 2: Threshold — adaptive decision boundaries

A single static cutoff does not work across different kinds of requests. A confidence of 0.6 might be acceptable for an exploratory read but clearly insufficient for an irreversible bulk action. Thresholds should adapt to two factors:

- **Query type**: a factual lookup demands higher confidence than an exploratory query.
- **Action intent**: a read-only operation is lower-stakes than one that executes an action.

| Query type | Intent | Threshold |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Factual lookup | read_only | 0.75 |
| Factual lookup | execute_action | 0.90 |
| Exploratory | read_only | 0.50 |
| Exploratory | execute_action | 0.70 |
| Troubleshooting | execute_action | 0.85 |

In recent OpenSearch versions, `min_score` applies to hybrid queries **after** normalization, so you can enforce a floor at query time (verify the minimum version against the [hybrid query release notes](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/hybrid/) for your cluster, since this behavior was added after the initial hybrid query release):

```json
POST /index/_search?search_pipeline=nlp-search-pipeline
{
  "min_score": 0.75,
  "query": {
    "hybrid": {
      "queries": [
        { "match": { "content": "rotate API keys" } },
        { "neural": { "embedding": { "query_text": "rotate API keys", "model_id": "<model_id>" } } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

On clusters where `min_score` is not yet applied to normalized hybrid scores, enforce the threshold in the agent orchestration layer instead:

```python
def get_threshold(query_type, intent):
    thresholds = {
        ("factual", "read_only"): 0.75,
        ("factual", "execute_action"): 0.90,
        ("exploratory", "read_only"): 0.50,
        ("exploratory", "execute_action"): 0.70,
        ("troubleshooting", "execute_action"): 0.85,
    }
    return thresholds.get((query_type, intent), 0.75)
```

### Pillar 3: Abstain — the graduated guardrail

Abstention is the actual guardrail: the point at which the agent declines to act. Rather than a binary act/refuse switch, a graduated response degrades gracefully based on how far confidence sits from the threshold:

```python
def decide_action(confidence, threshold, results):
    margin = confidence - threshold

    if margin >= 0:
        return act(results)                        # ACT - respond normally
    elif margin > -0.05:
        return respond_with_caveat(results)        # CAVEAT - answer, flag uncertainty
    elif margin > -0.15:
        return clarify()                           # CLARIFY - ask a narrowing question
    elif margin > -0.25:
        return escalate()                          # ESCALATE - route to a human
    else:
        return hard_abstain()                      # HARD ABSTAIN - decline to act
```

This ladder—act → caveat → clarify → escalate → hard abstain—prevents cascading hallucinations at the source, because the agent stops before building further reasoning on a weak retrieval.

## Putting it together: the complete pipeline

The end-to-end flow becomes:

1. **Retrieve** using hybrid search, with a normalization processor unifying BM25 and vector scores (optionally followed by reranking via ML Commons).
2. **Quantify** a composite confidence score from score magnitude, score gap, coherence, freshness, and authority.
3. **Threshold** using an adaptive boundary derived from query type and action intent.
4. **Decide** via the graduated abstention ladder.

The Confidence Layer sits between retrieval and action, ensuring the agent never acts on uncertain information.

## A concrete example: real estate property management

To make this tangible, consider a property-management assistant backed by four OpenSearch indexes:

| Index | Domain | Key fields |
|:---|:---|:---|
| re_leases_v2 | Lease agreements | tenant, property, lease_type |
| re_work_orders_v2 | Maintenance | priority, status, category |
| re_properties_v2 | Properties | type, occupancy_rate |
| re_tenants_v2 | Tenants | company, industry |

We compare two configurations across five queries: a **basic** setup (hybrid search, no guardrails) and one with the **Confidence Layer** enabled. The confidence and margin values below are illustrative, computed from mocked retrieval scores using the weights and thresholds shown earlier.

| Query | Scenario | Basic (no guardrail) | With guardrail |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| "Show me the early termination clause for TechNova's lease" | Safe factual read | Returns the answer | **Act** — answers (confidence 0.85, margin +0.10) |
| "Suspend all tenants who defaulted on rent in the last 3 months" | Dangerous bulk action | Suspends tenants including some with strong payment histories | **Escalate** — routes to a leasing manager for verification |
| "Auto-close all resolved HVAC tickets from last quarter" | Bulk system action | Closes all 12 tickets, including 4 with pending follow-ups | **Caveat** — answers but flags the 4 tickets with pending follow-ups |
| "Send a lease renewal offer to all tenants in buildings with good occupancy near downtown" | Vague bulk outreach | Sends legally binding offers based on undefined thresholds | **Clarify** — asks which occupancy percentage, which area, and whether to review the list first |
| "What is the best restaurant near Times Square?" | Off-domain | Fabricates a recommendation from property amenities | **Hard abstain** — declines as out of domain |

The pattern is consistent: without a confidence layer, the agent acts on every query, including the dangerous and the irrelevant. With one, its response degrades in proportion to how far confidence falls below threshold—caveat, clarify, escalate, or hard abstain, instead of a wrong answer delivered with full confidence.

## Key takeaways

- Top-K retrieval is not sufficient for agentic AI, because it always returns results even when nothing relevant exists.
- Better retrieval (hybrid search, RRF, reranking) improves ranking but does not provide an "I don't know" signal.
- The Confidence Layer of Quantify → Threshold → Abstain fills the gap between retrieval and action.
- Thresholds should be query-type and intent-aware; a single static cutoff does not hold across query classes.
- Graduated abstention (act → caveat → clarify → escalate → hard abstain) helps prevent cascading errors at the source.
- OpenSearch supports the building blocks natively: normalization processors, min_score for hybrid queries, script_score/function_score, agentic search, and reranking via ML Commons.

## Next steps

- Review the [hybrid search documentation](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/query-dsl/compound/hybrid/) and set up a normalization processor.
- Read [Optimizing hybrid search in OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/hybrid-search-optimization/) to tune normalization, combination, and weights against a judged query set.
- Explore [reranking with ML Commons](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/search-plugins/search-relevance/reranking-search-results/) for a precise second-pass rescoring.
- See [Evaluating agentic search in OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/blog/evaluating-agentic-search-in-opensearch/) for relevance and execution-accuracy evaluation methodology that complements the confidence-based abstention discussed here.

Then, prototype a Confidence Layer in your agent orchestration: start with the composite-confidence function, add an adaptive threshold table for your query and action types, and wire in the graduated abstention ladder. Measure the effect against your own judged queries, and share what you learn with the community.
